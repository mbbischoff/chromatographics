        <pre>
            one fifty-four
            is not the hour
            to send texts,
            no autocorrect
            
            risky confessions
            clipped affections
            dimmed i love you’s
            from neon rooms
            
            could be a typo
            should i just lol
            or say her name,
            reply the same?
            
            an oops can’t erase
            the thrumming bass
            as juniper slips
            from her bruised lips
            
            tripping on her tongue
            fuck. uhh. drunk. umm.
            not that
            not yet
            
            or at least —
            not like this
