back then, i saw your body just on screens —
pinpricks of light transferred across the line.
soft curves and folds, i felt you in my dreams;
those pictures, now, are burned into my mind.

and then i touched your silken skin at last,
traced these lines with red ink until they dripped,
gripped thighs while kissing slow, then hard & fast,
embraced to warm the places we had stripped.

but now i’m separated from your touch,
yearning for the ways we fit, like jigsaw
pieces you never need to force too much.
despite it all : _i’m here. i won’t withdraw._

you’re nude before my eyes, no matter where.
i’ll drink you up and leave them none to spare.
