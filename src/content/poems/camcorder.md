twentysomething object
built to take a beatingâ€”
recording blurry scenes
to wound cassette tapes.

humming with precision
opening up when pressed
her red button worndown
by many careless owners.

secondhand machine with
new ways of seeing inside
freezing a frame when it
canâ€™t take this much inâ€¦

an observation device for
triangular dynamics that
separate signal and static
projecting what is actual.

a new lease on life from
repairs to its internals,
charging, maintenance, &
importantly: regular use.
