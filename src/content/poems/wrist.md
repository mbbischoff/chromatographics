i clocked the watch once
and wished its red hand
swept across your face
i knew iâ€™d want the date

i saw the toyâ€™s hallmark
that predates its maker
cupidâ€™s bow pointillism
it looked best in color

i slipped on a staircase
tripped on slippery oak
fell into a concrete pool
cut and bruised joints

you caught me there
held meâ€Šâ€”â€Šrubbed salt
into my fresh wounds
to heal and to hurt me

a thin black strap is all
that holds back the sun
when this camera falls
itâ€™ll leak light forever

three solid bands form
an unbroken bracelet
brass never gleamed
until becoming a label

holding mine down
against white silk,
gray wool, graffiti
itâ€™s easy to go deep
