door opens— am i the fool?
gloves snap, now i’m playing my role
unstained steel tray cradles your tools
you wash me clean, i cede control

you sketch small leaves in purple ink
i play with you, this is our game
when it’s all done, what will they think?
art, artist, work— all share a name

calmly you ask “_ready for stabs?_”
there’s not a way for me to know
is this your temple or your lab?
we share one breath, it’s time to go

your sword and your eyes penetrate
music and pain blanket my brain
sometimes we should disregulate 
questions pour out, blood from a vein

hours pass as you make passes
pricks turn into private pleasure 
when we are through, our flesh collapses
every mark is made forever
