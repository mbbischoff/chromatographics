if you’re hearing this,
it’s ’cause i trust you.
there’s a lot of detail,
high resolution scans.

i take an early flight.
nothing good is easy.
_what am i forgetting?_
chocolate orange peels.

i program on the airplane
to distract from humming
in my eardrums; an engine
whirring to life in my chest.

she applies the night before
risks her body just for more.
she knows she has to see it
before i remember my face.

jetway’s made of glass,
eyes have steel blades.
_what am i forgetting?_
54-inch red shoelace.

_“do you want to get the
fuck out of this airport?”_
she picks up both bags
before i can say a word.

she borrows a tapedeck.
i hold her knee. _is this ok?_
the postal service can’t
ship this in a flat rate box.

distance desires ritual
we find a matchbook
_what am i forgetting?_
ashen coffee. burning.

the next thing i know
we’re at the terminal.
lipstick can stain more
than cardboard cups
