now please, sit back
stretch out your legs
relax awhile —
furniture begs

pull off your boots
i’ll kneel below
slip off your socks
and take it slow

bare both your soles
flex all ten toes
your footstool’s goal:
to be repose

our arches meet —
my back, your curve
almost so much
i don’t deserve

a faint perfume
teases my nose
the smoothest skin
so rarely shows

i’ll work them deep
with oiled hands
their perfect forms
each digit fanned

red lacquered nails
command my eyes
and higher heels
you’ve made me buy

bare, they stay – no
decoration
focus trained on
adoration

pressed on my face
i’ll kiss you there
and lick the base
become ensnared

kick or trample
i’ll take the pain
with shoes sampled
my body strains

pleads for pressure
that space between —
the greatest pleasure:
touch from the queen

release the jewels
that flood within
wetness pools
on shining skin
