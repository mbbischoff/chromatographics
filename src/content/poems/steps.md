now please, sit back
stretch out your legs
relax awhileâ€Šâ€”
furniture begs

pull off your boots
iâ€™ll kneel below
slip off your socks
and take it slow

bare both your soles
flex all ten toes
your footstoolâ€™s goal:
to be repose

our arches meetâ€Šâ€”
my back, your curve
almost so much
i donâ€™t deserve

a faint perfume
teases my nose
the smoothest skin
so rarely shows

iâ€™ll work them deep
with oiled hands
their perfect forms
each digit fanned

red lacquered nails
command my eyes
and higher heels
youâ€™ve made me buy

bare, they stayâ€Šâ€“â€Šno
decoration
focus trained on
adoration

pressed on my face
iâ€™ll kiss you there
and lick the base
become ensnared

kick or trample
iâ€™ll take the pain
with shoes sampled
my body strains

pleads for pressure
that space betweenâ€Šâ€”
the greatest pleasure:
touch from the queen

release the jewels
that flood within
wetness pools
on shining skin
