the black bottle kept
just out of reach
of those who fear
my obsidian liquid

a toxicology report:
deadly in large doses
but taken with care
the hurting heals us

sure, share a nightcap
wince with me in pain
we need this to sting
no easier, knowing it

small sips are sweet
deeper drinks, bitter
stone fruit can’t mask
a burning this intense

scared to let you see
me like this — red eyes
pierce pewter framing
you want, no, need to

as the spirit fully hits
there’s no stopping this
            *drink.*
the cork is broken now
