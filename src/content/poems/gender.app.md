pull out my phone
tap on the app
needs to update…
they always do

new gradient
same icon shape
wide colorspace
hard to adjust

why do we all
want to shapeshift?
to be seen through
filters we make

on the G train
dark grey sweatshirt
black leather boots
riding crosstown

slider tempts me—
drag it slowly
no one else stares
they just don’t care

this is my stop:
girl in red dress
heels to match her
lipstick and tits

costume changes
inside closets
infinite fits
incoherence

it’s not just me,
everyone plays
gender’s this game’s
in-app purchase

micro actions
& transactions
never enough
to fill the space

if i’m always
searching for it,
the right setting,
flipping through them

will i know when
i have nailed it?
new release notes: 
patches the bugs

what if i’m stuck
inside a loop?
keep it running
there’s no kill switch
