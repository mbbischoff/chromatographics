have you ever
had a girl cause
engineering
just for it, though

weeks of design
on a one-off
built for the thingâ€‰â€”
to program it

on the airplane
commit to it:
make it perfect,
then install it

when you get there,
show it slowly
touch a curved shape
feel its edges

unarchive it
press it with force
watch it open,
animated

every app must
have its settings
even if they
never vary

have you ever
caused a toy to
glow from within
white light blinking

when you read it
you can see it:
why it matters,
what youâ€™ll put there

have you ever
caused a thing to
strip itself bare
kernel panic!

this will only
take a second,
last a lifetime
deep within you

type it all out
hold it down now
your domain, name
hit the button

have you ever
felt an object
as itâ€™s written
becoming yours
