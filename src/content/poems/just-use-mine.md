he’s wanted one, i think, a while
still growing his, it takes its time
i wonder: _why not just use mine?_

our parts are modular by design
they’re aftermarket optimized
hot-swappable and still divine

then i’m above and he’s below
press into him, extend a loan
tell him: _touch, like it’s your own_

he strokes it like a precious gift
he must be worried, he’ll miss it
the gratitude vibrates his wrist

he shakes as need remaps the mind
and both our systems intertwine
we once mistake his flesh for mine

i ask him softly if it was good
he nods like i rewound the world
we had made what no one could
