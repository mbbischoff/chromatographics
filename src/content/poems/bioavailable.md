there’s always a question
when i come into contact
with the substance of you.

how much of you can i absorb?
when you enter my bloodstream,
swim my veins where they lead.

the longer your half-life,
the more i’ll feel you there,
coursing through my core.

the closer your shape
gets to nature, the better
i can fully take you in.

drink you or swallow you
or let you dissolve under
my tongue every day as

you transform me with
area under your curves.
when is my next dose?
