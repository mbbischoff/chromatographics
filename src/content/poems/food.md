a girl’s gotta eat,
grow big & strong
food becomes fuel
fired brick oven

i have reservations,
my seat’s set aside
gin martini stirred—
small coin of lemon<span style="color: #FEDB00;">.</span>

white pressed linens
red leather cushions
polished steel fixtures
scarred marble veins

amuse my palate
gift from the chef
_we kindly request:_
_no sharing allowed_

a girl’s gotta eat,
wash away fears
enjoy my choices
wet lips, appetite

taste first with eyes
each flavor distinct:
salt, grit, acid, burn
hungering for it all

the first bite builds
anticipation of more—
a mindless chewing,
my posture softens

i lick your plate clean
_it’s been taken care of_
have i saved any room?
no, some other time
