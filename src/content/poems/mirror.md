iâ€™m sorry i bumped into you. 
i thought you were a mirror. 
your clear surface showed 
what they saw of me then.

parties are meant for diffusion,
but we focused instead. 
twisting the lens to almost 
make out what was there.

iâ€™m sorry i couldnâ€™t touch you. 
i thought you were a mirror. 
i feared leaving greasy prints
for everyone to see.

museums of mailboxes and phones
reveal past and future connections.
a presentâ€Šâ€”
behind smudged display glass.

iâ€™m sorry you didnâ€™t see me
waving at you in the city.
i thought you were a mirror.
you werenâ€™t yet waving back.

being gay is hard sometimes. 
hotel bathrooms get steamy,
you canâ€™t always get the right angle
before the image blurs. 

iâ€™m sorry we were interrupted. 
i thought you were a mirror.
i never dreamed anyone would
walk through it and shatter the glass.

i need to move but i canâ€™t sleep. 
some things arenâ€™t done yet. 
iâ€™m hiding from sunrise, from men,
under blankets and cardboard towers.

iâ€™m sorry i looked so long.
i knew you were a mirror,
but i couldnâ€™t spot the vanishing point.
some reflections distort; yours perfects.
