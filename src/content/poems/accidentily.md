one fifty-four
is not the hour
to send texts,
no autocorrect

risky confessions
clipped affections
dimmed i love you's
from neon rooms

could be a typo
should i just lol
or say her name,
reply the same?
            
an oops can't erase
the thrumming bass
as juniper slips
from her bruised lips

tripping on her tongue
<em>fuck. uhh. drunk. umm.</em>
not that
not yet

or at least â€”
not like this
