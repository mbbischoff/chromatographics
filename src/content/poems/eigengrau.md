the only way to ignore
the sunrise is to close
our eyes at daybreak

white light pours through
delicate curtain laceâ€”
an unseen ocean roiling

more to see and to say
as blue waves beckon,
calling toward tomorrow

but no matter what we try,
thereâ€™s no true darkness.
light seeps in everywhere

the shade we find there
feels almost ultraviolet;
we see it together, apart

in separate beds, rooms
on opposed coasts, we
conjure the same cosmos

this color could be our own.
when other lovers see it too,
do they know we bathe in it?
