random chance meeting
sweater that shimmers
parties are fleeting
your glances glimmer

post selfies in slack
our dms vanish
a coffee date ask
making a plan-ish?

calls about lost work
texts about gender
watching your lil’ smirk
my heart grows tender

shopping for red skirts
sharing a small lunch
enjoying my quirks
i’m having a hunch…

flirting a little
to see if it sticks
too noncommittal?
or does it just click

late night at a show
we let our legs brush
at the bar i chose
you admit your crush

a ride to your place
the tension growing
sharing a small space
finally knowing

nervously waiting
for you to arrive
_fuck, now we’re dating._
we instantly vibe
