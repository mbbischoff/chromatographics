half decade wishes:
a leveling out.
forbidden kisses
the right choice, no doubt

central park consult
king cole martini
review old results
discard bikinis

photograph the curves
archives in high gloss
the things i preserve,
they’ll surely just toss

day before phone calls
rage at the system
its stops, starts, & stalls
need to assist him

sleep, holding a heart
cleanse every surface
wrong name on the chart
_of course you deserve this_

wave as the doors close
_don’t use the “b” word_
eat eggs as you doze
the artwork looks blurred

a husband’s phone rings
let me inside there
treat you like a king
hold cups as your care

bumpy ride that night
late rooftop phone call
two beams of bright light
never forget fall

a week goes by fast
managing your pain
see yourself at last
straight scars and no drain

i cry more than you do
it hits me deeply
this thing that you choose
didn’t come cheaply

a body transformed
like overnight oats
years since your plans formed
i’ll keep taking notes
