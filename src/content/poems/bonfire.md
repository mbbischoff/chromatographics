we spin on turntables
gift-wrapped bubbles
plotting high treason

one query hangs on
a hook near my thigh
_“how do you want to feel?”_

you produce three words
two supple, one sharp
relaxed. caregiven. surrender.

we better not have another
handle’s cold to the touch
i hold your hand for warmth

fetching a towel and water
unfamiliar closet and faucet
you aren’t used to this, are you?

inside these walls, a forest
i lead you down the worn path
to a fire blazing at the center

it’s just us dancing there —
adjust angles, rhyme rhythms
dig holes with feet and fingers

you haven’t visited in years
moonlight in an empty room
i’ve never been, but will again

draw maps into memory
twist silver, pink, and blue
the way back is circular
