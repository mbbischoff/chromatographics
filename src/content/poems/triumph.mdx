import Sticker from '../../components/Sticker.astro';

you outfit us in leather armor
tie boots tight as heartstrings
we dance and breathe as one
enter prisms — offset blinking

<Sticker textColor='black' borderColor='black'>
INFORMATION GLADLY GIVEN
BUT SAFETY REQUIRES AVOIDING
UNNECESSARY CONVERSATION
</Sticker>

underground, understand a halo
grip my thighs below your wings
breathe — you ask "_you ready?_"
to leave, to ride, to fly. of course.

don't look down & don't let go
become part of a red machine:
a bell, a backpack, a balance
gripping tightly, holding loosely

i am not afraid to ride with you
to glide across rock and sound
my pilot is divine, invincible even
molded contours promise safety

<Sticker textColor='#D01C1F' borderColor='#D01C1F'>
PLEASE HOLD ON 
SUDDEN STOPS ARE
SOMETIMES NECESSARY
</Sticker>

as we swerve, we synchronize
we're on an island, smiling wide
small compared to a lighthouse
even smaller against your frame

my sister thought she could fall
along the same route we travel
but i know i fell for you already
ache is just what flight feels like
