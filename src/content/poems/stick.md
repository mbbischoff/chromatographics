winter cherry, lush
pressed to the paneâ€Š:
clear swirling glass,
vessels for grapes

red print attracts
gazes from gays
strange artifacts
mouths go astray

first contact lasts
longer than stains
washed away fastâ€Šâ€”
much like our brains

they always say
lips that disguise
canâ€™t be the way,
but never the why

shouldnâ€™t we just
paint what we feel
even if lips must
become the meal
