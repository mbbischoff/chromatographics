winter cherry, lush
pressed to the pane :
clear swirling glass,
vessels for grapes

red print attracts
gazes from gays
strange artifacts
mouths go astray

first contact lasts
longer than stains
washed away fast —
much like our brains

they always say
lips that disguise
can’t be the way,
but never the why

shouldn’t we just
paint what we feel
even if lips must
become the meal
